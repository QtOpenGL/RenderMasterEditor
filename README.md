# RenderMasterEditor
Editor for [Render Master engine](https://github.com/fra-zz-mer/RenderMaster)

## Build
Build engine first with Visual Studio. Then build editor with Qt Creator. I use 4.4.1.
You can debug editor with Qt Editor or with Visual Studio (there is dummy project "Editor "in engine repository).
